Problem Statement

Alice is planning to organize a contest with 4 players in each team. There are two types of players named Experienced and Freshers. To make the contest unbiased Alice wants to have a team in such a way that each team must contain at least 1 Experienced and 1 Fresher. You are given N the number of Experienced and the number of Freshers. Your task is to determine the maximurn number of team formations possible.

Note:

No team member can join more than one team.

Input Format:

The input consists of a single line:

The first line contains two space-separated integers N and M.

The input will be read from the STDIN by the candidate.

Output Format:

Print the number that represents the maximum number of team formations possible.

The output will be matched to the candidate's output printed on the STDOUT.

        // The maximum number of teams is limited by:
        // 1. The total number of players divided by 4 (since each team needs 4 members)
        // 2. The minimum of Experienced and Freshers (since each team needs at least 1 of each)
        int maxTeams = Math.min((N + M) / 4, Math.min(N, M));
        
        // Print the result
        System.out.println(maxTeams);
    }
