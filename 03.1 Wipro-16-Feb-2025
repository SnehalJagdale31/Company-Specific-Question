Problem Statement

You are given a, d, and n which represents 1 term of an Arithmetic Progression, common difference, and number n respectively four task is to find and print the nth term of this Arithmetic Progression.

Arithmetic Progression: Arithmetic Progression is a sequence of numbers in which each term after the first is obtained by adding a constant d to the proceding term. The constant d is called the common difference.

nth term = a+(n-1)*d

Input Format:

The input consists of a single line:

The line contains three integers a, d, and n

The input will be read from the STDIN by the candidate

Output Format:

Print the nth term of this Arithmetic Progression.

The output will be matched to the candidate's output printed on the STDOUT

        sc.close(); // Close the scanner to avoid resource leaks
        
        // Calculate the nth term using the formula: nth term = a + (n - 1) * d
        int nthTerm = a + (n - 1) * d;
        
        // Print the result
        System.out.println(nthTerm);
