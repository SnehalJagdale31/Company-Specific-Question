//Note: The main class name must be "Solution".

//The company Digital Secure Data Transfer Solutions provides data encryption and data sharing services. Their process uses a key K for encryption when transmitting characters. To encrypt a character the character is replaced by the following Kth character with the same case in the English alphabet set.
//The English alphabet set is considered in a cyclic fashion for the last K characters.
//Write an algorithm to find the character used to encrypt the given character.
//Input
//The first line of the input consists of a character character, representing the character to be transmitted. 
//The second line consists of an integer key, representing the key (K).
//Output
//Print a character representing the encrypted
